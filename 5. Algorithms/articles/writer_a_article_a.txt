In the dim confines of his musty apartment, Anton Zubov lay sprawled upon the thin mattress, the tick of the clock on the wall counting down every agonizing second that bound him to his existence. That tick had haunted him for weeks, an accursed reminder of both time’s relentless progression and his own descent into moral degradation. Every thought he entertained seemed to echo his insufficiencies, his betrayals, his absolute failure to uphold anything resembling honor or conscience. He clutched at his brow, a physical attempt to claw free the sickening guilt that clung to his mind like tar. For all his attempts at self-justification, every reason seemed nothing but a flimsy disguise. What was he, he wondered, if not a fraud of the highest degree, a man so lost in his own mind that he had become a shadow, flickering aimlessly without substance or reason?

This existential crisis burned with particular vigor after his last misstep, one so small that any other man would have dismissed it as inconsequential. Yet for Zubov, a simple utterance to his sister—an unwelcome truth that he had dared to reveal without proper restraint—had left him reeling. He could not sleep, he could not eat; the guilt surged within him like a fevered storm. His sister had looked at him, a soft, almost pitying expression that he despised even more than outright accusation, and it was in that gaze he found himself shattered. He had tasted the sharp bite of conscience, and with it, a terror that there was nothing beneath his skin but a hollow echo. This torment, this haunting echo, was now his sole companion, dragging him into a dark and endless abyss.
