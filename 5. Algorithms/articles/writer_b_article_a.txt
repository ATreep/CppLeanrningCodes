The sun was a merciless overseer in the sky, bearing down upon the fishermen as they navigated the open sea. They were four men, all silent as they rowed, their eyes trained on the horizon where the water met the sky. It was an endless stretch of blue, marred only by the glinting peaks of the waves, which seemed to mock their every stroke with a casual disregard. Santiago, the eldest of the four, squinted against the sun, his face etched with lines deeper than those of the other men, and yet there was a quiet acceptance there, a resignation to the fact that nature cared nothing for his suffering, his triumphs, or his losses. Out here, under the relentless watch of the sky and sea, man was nothing more than another creature, adrift in a vast world that neither hated nor loved him.

There was a certain peace in that realization, Santiago thought, as he watched the water churn beneath the boat. Nature did not change to suit man’s desires; it remained cold and unyielding, a constant that reminded him of his own insignificance. He gripped the oar with hands roughened by years of work, hands that had battled the sea, hands that bore the scars of his efforts. Yet, even with the knowledge of nature’s indifference, he felt a quiet pride. Yes, the sea was uncaring, and the sun would burn on regardless of his existence. But he was here, alive, rowing into the vast unknown, defying nature not with anger or hope, but with a simple will to survive. And that, he knew, was enough.
