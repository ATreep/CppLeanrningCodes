That evening, as they made camp by the shore, Santiago looked out over the darkening waters, a calm settling over him. He had come to this place many times, enduring storms that had left him with nothing but the clothes on his back, yet he returned. He returned because there was something in the fight itself, something in the act of facing down nature with nothing but his own two hands, that made him feel whole. “What keeps you coming back?” one of the younger men had once asked him, and Santiago had smiled. “A man must do what he is made to do,” he’d replied, a simple truth that needed no elaboration. For Santiago, the struggle against the sea was not a quest for glory or gain, but a testament to his own existence.

As the others drifted into sleep, Santiago lay awake, listening to the crash of waves against the shore, a sound as ancient as time itself. He thought about the fish he had caught, the countless hours spent rowing, the moments when he had nearly lost hope. But here, with the stars spread above him and the sea breathing at his feet, he felt an odd contentment. In a world that moved on without pause, a world that would one day forget him entirely, he had found his place. It was a simple thing, perhaps, to find meaning in struggle. But as he looked at the horizon, he realized that, in the end, it was all he had ever needed.
