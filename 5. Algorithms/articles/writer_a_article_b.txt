He often wandered in the streets of Petersburg, finding solace in the anonymous crowd, though even there he felt the prickling bite of his own isolation. These people around him moved in a cadence he could neither understand nor join; they were blissfully, ignorantly alive. For Zubov, however, life was a burden, a series of moral quandaries that bore down upon his soul with unceasing weight. He would look at a common laborer—an old woman selling bread, a young soldier laughing with friends—and wonder what it was like to live without constantly dissecting one’s own thoughts, without feeling the sharp sting of awareness that turned every action, every word, into a form of punishment. He longed for ignorance, for some reprieve from the burden of intellect that gnawed at him like a parasite feeding on his marrow.

He remembered an evening at the university when he had recited a passage from Plato, his voice brimming with conviction, only to be met with derisive laughter. “And who are you, Zubov?” a classmate had sneered. “Do you think your philosophies make you better than us?” That question lingered, festering in his mind.
